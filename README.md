Tools for KSP with kRPC 


I will be adding info here as I add new files:

Thus far:

suicide_anywhere will return your ship to the surface of Kerbin, asap. Edit the specs to suit your ship as it does take some tweaking.
I will be creating a suicide_ksc script that will return your ship to KSC (one will be a return from orbit and one that will return an inactive vessel (Launch Booster) after launch)
I also plan on adding a general launch module (100km circ orbit)
